# Autonomous Car Simulation

Autonomous Car Simulation using Behavioral Cloning concept, all with step by step tutorial and explanation in the `Behavioral_cloning.ipynb` file.

## Downloading the Simulator

The simulator used for this project is from the **Udacity autonomous car nanodegree program simulator**. Please check out its [repository](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) for instructions to download and operate the simulator.

## Running the model

Before running the simulator, **drive.py** must be run to create a bi directional client-server communication 
between our model and the simulator; This is implemented using `socket.io`.
